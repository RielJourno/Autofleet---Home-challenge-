# Autofleet - Home-challenge:

Autofleet company, thank you for this challenge 
While this was a long and hard one, it was also a lot of fun.

The idea was to make a web app that helps the user manage his car business
by targeting the data of thor location.

I decided to use mongoDB to store the data.
In addition, I invested a lot in the distribution of folders (even when I did not have to)
to later develop a capability of magnification.

## The Design drawing:

Catching the polygon point and calculating if the car is inside the polygon was the tricky part
because it was hard to understand how to hook the drawing from Mapbox.
Although I have written the algorithm, It's still not working at the moment
My time was up and I still could not find a way out.
