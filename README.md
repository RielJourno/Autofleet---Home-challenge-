# Autofleet - Home-challenge:

Autofleet company, thank you for this challenge 
While this was a long and hard one, it was also a lot of fun.

The idea was to make a web app that helps the user manage his car business
by targeting the data of thor location.

I decided to use mongoDB to store the data.
In addition, I invested a lot in the distribution of folders (even when I did not have to)
to later develop a capability of magnification.

## The Desigen:
